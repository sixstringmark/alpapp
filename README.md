This is a one-click, node.js BigCommerce app to support Gun Import client feeds for Sportsman's Finest. 

You would need to configure the app in developer.bigcommerce.com to the URL where the app can be reached. I have been running it locally on my laptop and using and ngrok tunnel to make it accessible on the web.

It uses FTP, CSV, JSON, and plain XML file parsing, and Handlebars for the UI.

It is using BigCommerce catalog API to manage products with images, categories, and brands.
